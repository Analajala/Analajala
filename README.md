Enthusiam towards research made me to chose a path for pursuing Ph.D (Computer Science and Engineering) in Cloud storage systems at **[SRM University-AP](https://srmap.edu.in/)**

My research mainly focuses on improving the performance of read operations in distributed file system environment, so that the client requests can be served efficiently in a faster manner. Distributed file system acts as a back-end storage for cloud computing systems. To achieve this, I've developed novel HDFS architecture to improve the performance of distributed file system by applying novel Prefetching, caching, and replacement techniques.
